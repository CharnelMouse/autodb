Description: Automatic normalisation of a data frame to third normal form, with
  the intention of easing the process of data cleaning. (Usage to design your
  actual database for you is not advised.)
  Originally inspired by the 'AutoNormalize' library for 'Python' by 'Alteryx'
  (<https://github.com/alteryx/autonormalize>), with various changes and
  improvements. Automatic discovery of functional or approximate dependencies,
  normalisation based on those, and plotting of the resulting "database" via
  'Graphviz', with options to exclude some attributes at discovery time, or
  remove discovered dependencies at normalisation time.
