# Database-style normalisation for data.frames

Automatic normalisation of a data.frame to third normal form, with the
intention of easing the process of data cleaning. (Usage to design your
actual database for you is not advised.) Originally inspired by
Alteryx's AutoNormalize Python library
(https://github.com/alteryx/autonormalize), with various changes and
improvements. Automatic discovery of functional or approximate
dependencies, normalisation based on those, and plotting of the
resulting "database" via Graphviz, with options to exclude some
attributes at discovery time, or remove discovered dependencies at
normalisation time.
