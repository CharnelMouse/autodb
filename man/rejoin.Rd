\title{Join a database into a data frame}
\usage{
rejoin(database)
}
\arguments{
\item{database}{A database containing the data to be rejoined, as returned by
\code{\link{decompose}}.}
}
\value{
A data frame, containing all information contained \code{database} if
it is lossless and self-consistent.
}
\description{
Rejoins the relations in a database. This is the inverse of calling
\code{\link{autonorm}} with \code{accuracy} set to 1, except that the rows
might be returned in a different order.
}
\details{
The rejoining algorithm might not use all of the given relations: it begins
with the relation with the largest number of records, then joins it with enough
relations to contain all of the present attributes. This is not limited to
relations that the starting relation is linked to by foreign keys, and is not
limited to them either, since in some cases this constraint would make it
impossible to rejoin with all of the present attributes.

If the database is inconsistent, where the unused relations contain
additional information, then the rejoining will be lossy. The algorithm does
not check for this consistency violation. This is also the case for rejoining
the results of \code{\link{reduce}}.
