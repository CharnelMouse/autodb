\usage{
discover_keys(
  df,
  keep_rownames = FALSE,
  digits = getOption("digits"),
  exclude = character(),
  exclude_class = character(),
  size_limit = ncol(df),
  progress = FALSE,
  progress_file = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data.frame, the relation to evaluate.}

\item{keep_rownames}{a logical or a string, indicating whether to include the
row names as a column. If a string is given, it is used as the name for the
column, otherwise the column is named "row". Like with the other column
names, the function returns an error if this results in duplicate column
names. Set to FALSE by default.}

\item{digits}{a positive integer, indicating how many significant digits are
to be used for numeric and complex variables. A value of \code{NA} results
in no rounding. By default, this uses \code{getOption("digits")}, similarly
to \code{\link{format}}. See the "Floating-point variables" section for
\code{\link{discover}} for why this rounding is necessary for consistent
results across different machines. See the note in
\code{\link{print.default}} about \code{digits >= 16}.}

\item{exclude}{a character vector, containing names of attributes to not
consider as members of keys. If names are given that aren't present in
\code{df}, the user is given a warning.}

\item{exclude_class}{a character vector, indicating classes of attributes to
not consider as members of keys. Attributes are excluded if they inherit
from any given class.}

\item{size_limit}{an integer, indicating the largest key size to search for.
By default, this is large enough to allow all attributes.}

\item{progress}{a logical, for whether to display progress to the user during
dependency search in \code{\link{discover}}.}

\item{progress_file}{a scalar character or a connection. If \code{progress}
is non-zero, determines where the progress is written to, in the same way
as the \code{file} argument for \code{\link[base]{cat}}.}
}
\value{
A list of character vectors, containing the discovered keys. The
attributes within each key are given in the same order as in \code{df}.
}
\description{
Finds all the keys for a data frame, ignoring duplicate rows.
}
\details{
Column names for \code{df} must be unique.

The search algorithm was adapted from the FDHits algorithm used for
\code{\link{discover}}. It is likely to be an implementation of the HPIValid
algorithm, although it wasn't used directly as a source. It has the same
implications with respect to floating-point variables.

\examples{
# simple example
discover_keys(ChickWeight)

# example with spurious key
discover_keys(CO2)
# exclude attributes that can't be determinants.
# in this case, the numeric attributes are now
# not determined by anything, because of repeat measurements
# with no variable to mark them as such.
discover_keys(CO2, exclude_class = "numeric")
# exclude keys spuriously using the measurement attribute
discover_keys(CO2, exclude = "uptake")
